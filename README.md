10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data analysis with Scanpy
<br>
I will be primarily using Scanpy which is an open-source Python library for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for quality control, visualization, preprocessing, clustering, differential expression analysis, trajectory inference, and other common tasks in scRNA-seq data analysis.

We may also find the need to use Anndata library, short for "AnnData" (Annotated Data), which is a widely used data structure in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. It is part of the Scanpy library and provides a flexible and efficient way to store, manipulate, and analyze scRNA-seq data.

Anndata is designed to organize and integrate diverse types of genomic data associated with individual cells. It consists of two main components:

Data matrices: Anndata stores the gene expression data in a matrix-like format. The matrix represents the expression levels of genes across individual cells. By convention, the rows of the matrix correspond to genes (features), and the columns correspond to cells (observations).

Annotations: Anndata allows the annotation of cells and features with additional metadata. This metadata can include cell type annotations, experimental conditions, sample information, gene symbols, genomic coordinates, and any other relevant attributes.

Anndata provides a unified framework for storing scRNA-seq data and associated annotations, making it easier to perform various data manipulations and analyses. It offers a rich set of functionalities, including data filtering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression analysis, visualization, and more.

Anndata objects can be created from various data sources, such as raw count matrices, sparse matrices, CSV files, or by importing data from other formats like 10x Genomics' Cell Ranger output.

## **Load data**
<br>
We will be using Visum data, as 10X made it easy for us to access their amazing datasets. <br>
10x Visium is a spatial transcriptomics technology developed by 10x Genomics. It allows for the simultaneous profiling of gene expression and spatial information within intact tissue sections. By preserving the spatial context of gene expression, Visium enables researchers to study the spatial organization of cells and molecular interactions within complex tissues.

The Visium technology utilizes a spatially barcoded array, called a Visium Slide, which consists of a glass slide with an array of capture areas. Each capture area contains spatial barcodes and oligonucleotide probes that capture and amplify the RNA molecules within that region. The captured RNA molecules are then sequenced to obtain gene expression profiles for each spatial location.

The workflow of 10x Visium typically involves the following steps:

Sample preparation: Tissue sections are prepared on the Visium Slide, and the RNA molecules within each section are crosslinked and preserved. The tissue can be fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE).

Spatial capture: The Visium Slide is loaded onto a 10x Genomics instrument, and reverse transcription and spatially barcoded capture of RNA molecules occur within each capture area. The spatial barcodes allow the assignment of each RNA molecule to its corresponding spatial location.

Library preparation: The captured RNA molecules are amplified, and a sequencing library is prepared. The library contains both gene expression information and spatial barcodes.

Sequencing: The library is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies, generating readouts for both gene expression and spatial barcodes.

Data analysis: The sequenced data is then processed and analyzed using bioinformatics tools, such as the Scanpy package, to explore gene expression patterns, identify cell types, visualize spatial relationships, and extract biological insights from the spatially resolved transcriptomic data.

**Dataset** 
<br>
For Visium spatial transcriptomics data, you may find two directories, one for raw and the other for filtered, typically refers to the different stages of data processing specific to the Visium technology.

**Raw data directory:**

The raw data directory for Visium contains the original, unprocessed sequencing data generated by the Visium platform. It includes the raw sequencing files, such as FASTQ files, which contain the raw reads obtained from the Visium spatial transcriptomics experiment.
<br>
These raw sequencing files capture the spatially resolved gene expression information for each spot on the tissue section.

**Filtered data directory:**

The filtered data directory for Visium contains the processed and filtered version of the sequencing data obtained from the Visium experiment. It includes files or data that have undergone various preprocessing and filtering steps specific to Visium data analysis.
<br>
The files in the filtered data directory may include processed count matrices, spatially normalized expression data, spatial coordinates, and other files resulting from the analysis of Visium data. <br>

The preprocessing and filtering steps applied to the raw Visium data typically include:


*   Demultiplexing: Identifying and assigning reads to their respective spatial spots or barcodes.
*   Barcode processing: Validating and filtering out low-quality barcodes or spots.
*   Gene expression quantification: Assigning read counts or transcript abundances to genes for each spot.
*   Normalization: Applying normalization methods to account for technical variation and differences in library sizes.
*   Quality control: Filtering out low-quality spots or genes based on various metrics, such as read counts or detection thresholds.
*   Quality control: Filtering out low-quality spots or genes based on various metrics, such as read counts or detection thresholds.


The filtered data directory provides the processed data that is ready for downstream analysis, including visualization, clustering, differential expression analysis, and spatial mapping of gene expression patterns.
